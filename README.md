You'll use the Azure AD HTTP client API included in the SharePoint Framework to authenticate and call the Microsoft Graph REST API.

- [Exercise - Call Microsoft Graph from SharePoint Framework components](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/sharepoint-spfx-graph-3rd-party-apis/7-exercise-graph-api)
